The document describes "Animation Events" but does not provide explicit code snippets for defining or handling them directly in the same way as `AnimationAction`. It mentions:
- Sound events - Play sounds at keyframes
- Particle events - Spawn particles during animation
- Damage events - Deal damage at specific frames
- Callback events - Trigger code at keyframes
