# com.hypixel.hytale.common

This package contains common utility classes used throughout the Hytale server.

## Overview

The `common` package provides a collection of general-purpose utility classes that are used across various parts of the Hytale server. These classes handle common tasks such as data structures, benchmarking, threading, and string manipulation.

### Key Concepts

*   **Benchmark:** Utilities for measuring and recording performance metrics.
*   **Collection:** Custom collection classes and utilities.
*   **FastUtil:** Integration with the fastutil library for optimized primitive collections.
*   **Map:** Custom map implementations and utilities.
*   **Plugin:** Classes related to plugin identification and manifests.
*   **Semver:** Utilities for semantic versioning.
*   **Thread:** Threading utilities.
*   **Tuple:** Tuple data structures.
*   **Util:** General utility methods for arrays, audio, bit manipulation, exceptions, formatting, hardware, networking, paths, random numbers, and strings.
